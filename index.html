        <p>You mentioned that you're not particularly special, didn't you? Well, let me tell you about something fascinating that happened yesterday. I was having a conversation with my crush, none other than the moon </p>

        <p>! Surprisingly, she seemed a bit shy, hiding behind the clouds and refusing to engage in conversation.</p>
           
        <p> I couldn't help but wonder why she was acting this way. Eventually, it became clear - she was jealous. Yes, the moon was jealous! She had learned about someone else, someone she perceived as more beautiful,<p>
           
        <p> kinder, and purer than herself. It was as though she couldn't bear the thought of someone else shining brighter than her in the night sky.</p>
        <p>You know, tonight I can't even sleep. It's raining, and I wonder if she is crying up there. You made her cry, man! Open your windows and apologize to her right now; otherwise, Trivandrum will be underwater </p>
        <P>tomorrow morning because of her tears</P>
        <p>
            Beneath the moon's gentle glow so bright,
            There's a girl who outshines the starry night.
            She might not know, but she's a true gem,
            In her smile, the moon finds a diadem.
            
            When she's feeling down, the moon sheds a tear,
            As rain on Earth, a sign she's near.
            But worry not, for her heart is pure,
            In her presence, the moon feels secure.
            
            She's the best, though she may not see,
            In her, the moon finds purest glee.
            So, smile bright, oh girl so fair,
            For in your light, the moon finds its lair</p>
        <p> for a lil melody devika </p>
